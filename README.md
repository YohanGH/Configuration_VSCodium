# VSCodium Configuration

Welcome to my VSCodium setup! This configuration aims to provide an efficient, visually appealing, and highly productive development environment tailored for web development, coding best practices, and seamless workflow integration. Below, you'll find details on the extensions I've incorporated into my VSCodium instance and the specific settings I've customized to enhance coding efficiency and comfort.

## Extensions

The following extensions form the backbone of my VSCodium setup, each selected for its role in optimizing the development experience:

- **Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 (v0.1.4):** Visually distinguishes between different sets of bracket pairs with varying colors for easier code navigation and understanding.
- **Code Runner (v0.12.1):** Offers the ability to run code snippets or files for multiple languages within VSCodium, streamlining the test-and-debug cycle.
- **Debugger for Chrome (v4.12.6):** Facilitates JavaScript debugging by enabling the execution of code within the Chrome browser directly from VSCodium.
- **Docker (v1.29.0):** Integrates Docker commands and management directly into the IDE, simplifying containerization tasks.
- **ESLint (v2.4.4):** Assists in maintaining code quality with JavaScript linting, ensuring adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- **GitLens â€” Git supercharged (v14.9.0):** Enhances Git capabilities within VSCodium, providing deeper insights into code history and changes.
- **Live Server (v5.7.9):** Instantly serves and hot-reloads web pages as code changes, ideal for frontend development.
- **Material Icon Theme (v4.34.0):** Beautifies the visual workspace with high-quality, themed icons for files and folders.
- **Multi-command (v1.6.0):** Allows the chaining of multiple commands with a single shortcut, enhancing productivity.
- **Power Mode (v3.0.2):** Adds visual effects to typing, making coding more engaging and fun.
- **Prettier - Code formatter (v10.4.0):** Automatically formats code to ensure consistency with coding standards.
- **Tokyo Night (v1.0.6):** A dark theme that provides a comfortable and stylish coding environment, reducing eye strain.
- **Vim (v1.27.2):** Brings Vim's modal editing features into VSCodium, catering to enthusiasts of Vim's efficiency.

## Configuration Settings

### Appearance Settings

- Minimal startup with `"workbench.startupEditor": "none"`.
- Disabled minimap and breadcrumbs for a cleaner code view.
- Adjusted sidebar indentation and always render indent guides for clarity.

### Ergonomics

- Enabled word wrap, smart suggestions, linked editing for HTML tags, and various file explorer enhancements for a smoother coding experience.
- Configured Emmet to expand on tab for faster HTML/CSS development.

### File Handling

- Set files to auto-save on focus change and default language to markdown, with specific file types excluded from the workspace.

### Language and Formatting

- Specified default formatters for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and JSON to maintain consistent coding styles across different file types.
- Tailored JavaScript and TypeScript settings for importing modules and file movement.

### Extensions-Specific Settings

- Customized settings for Live Server, GitLens, ESLint, Prettier, and Multi-Command to fit the development workflow.

### Theme and Visual Customizations

- Chosen fonts, sizes, and themes (Tokyo Night with Material Icon Theme) for an aesthetically pleasing and functional coding environment.
- Customized code selection background color for better visibility.

### Key Bindings

- A collection of custom key bindings to enhance navigation, file management, code selection, terminal handling, and formatting capabilities for an efficient development workflow.

This configuration is a result of continuous refinement and is aimed at developers looking for a balance between aesthetics, performance, and productivity in their coding environment. Feel free to adopt, modify, and share it as you see fit. Happy coding!
